# Timeless Dynamics (v14)
### A Variational Framework for Emergent Time

This repository contains the formalization and numerical verification of a configuration-space framework where time is not fundamental, but emergent.

## Core Axiom
Physical dynamics are derived from extremal paths through configuration space $\mathcal{C}$ governed by a timeless constraint. This model replaces the "Arrow of Time" with a **Record-Bias** mechanism.

## The 'Engine' (Toy Model)
The included `timeless_v1.py` demonstrates the **Recordability Condition**:
- **System:** 3-bit configuration space (A, B, M).
- **Mechanism:** Information-theoretic bias favors configurations where 'Records' (M) correlate with 'System States' (A).
- **Result:** An emergent statistical ordering arises from a static ensemble.

## Status: 2026 Audit
- **Theory:** v14 (Included as PDF)
- **Verification:** Discrete Toy Model (Functional)
- **Epistemic Auditor:** Gemini (Independent Audit Mode)
